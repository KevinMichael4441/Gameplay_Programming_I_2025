 * @object: The GameObject this mediator will look after.

 * right event at the FSM, so you don't have to micromanage every button press
 * like an overworked pub manager on a Friday night.

 * @command:  The command flags the player has kindly mashed together (big question can it be executed)

 * event handlers and state transitions further down the line.
